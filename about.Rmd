# About This Open Data Project

Dillon Ipsum Julie Taylor, will you marry me? Clear Eyes. Full Hearts. Saracen, quarterback's a captain. CHAMPIONS DON'T COMPLAIN! Why don't you take your Members Only jacket off and hang it on the coat rack? Blood, sweat and tears - it all stays right here on this field, right now! This is our dirt! This is our mud! This is ours, baby! Everybody leaves me! What's wrong with me? No matter what happens, no matter where you go, no matter what you do, I'm gonna be right behind you. Always and always and always. There's a lot of dude talking going on out here. It's time for you to let Tim Riggins come home. You're gonna be the star quarterback of the DIllon Panthers next year. And you are gonna shine.
